# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this workbook is to analyze the dataset provided for stock analysis of years 2017 & 2018. With a click of a button, the program asks for the year that the user wants to run the calculations, and returns "Total Daily Volume" as well as "Return" for different stock indices.



## Results
The refactored code runs faster than the original code. The reason is that in the original code, two nested loops is used while in the refactored code, no nested for loops is used.  The refactored code runs in about 0.11 s.

### Execution Time
### Stock Performance
In general, stocks performed better in 2017 compared to 2018. In 2017, only one stock had negative return, while in 2018, 10 out of 12 stocks had negative returns.


## Summary

In conclusion, refactored codes are easier to understand and they usually run faster than the original code. However, one possible disadvantage is that it may be time consuming to come up with a refactored code.

For this challenge, the refactored code runs faster than the original code, also the code is smoother and easier to understand. However, it may be difficult to come up with this refactored code.
